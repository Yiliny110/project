    "## Question 4\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "### 1. K-NN Classification Method and Plan\n",
    "Using 2 numeric predictors, **Age** and **played_hours**, to predict a catagorical variable is a significant binary k-nn classification problem. It works directly from the data using Euclidean distance without model training, which is a simple, intuitive algorithm The dataset is not very large (only 196 rows), which does not cost much to compute. <br><br>\n",
    "We split the **subscribe_scaled** dataframe to 70% training data and 30% testing data. Then We split the training data into 5 evenly sized chunks for the validation set to do cross-validation comparison to get the best k value we will use.\n",
    "### 2. Assumptions\n",
    "1. To use knn model, we assume the closest neighbor points are likely having the same class.\n",
    "2. The dataset contains enough observations because knn model needs many points to get the best k value and find neighbors.\n",
    "3. There is no parametric relationship between whether **Age** and **subscribe** or **played_hours** and **subscribe**. They are relatively random combinations for a player\n",
    "4. Since the \"Yes\" class represents the majority of **subscribe** in the training data, the majority classifier would always predict that a new observation is \"Yes\". The estimated accuracy of the majority classifier is usually fairly close to the majority class proportion in the training data. We would suspect that the majority classifier will have an accuracy of around 74%, as we calculated in .\n",
    "### 3. Weakness\n",
    "1. The **players.csv** is not a large data that has only 196 observations. The knn method might not be accurate with small dataset.\n",
    "2. There is NA in **Age** of some players, which might cause the prediction not accurate since knn model replace the missing data with the average value of closest neighbor points."
